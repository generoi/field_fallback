Fallback Field
==============

Provide a fallback field to use in case no value has been entered.
This can be used if you use two image fields on an entity (eg. banner and
teaser) but want to allow the user to only use one if necessary.

Installation
------------
1. Enable
2. Visit a field instance edit form and select a fallback field (only fields of
   the same type will be allowed, if none exist, the setting will not appear).
